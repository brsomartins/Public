<h1>Assignment 6</h1>


<ol>
	<li>For this assignment, you will be creating a basic HTML page which includes simple JavaScript functionality.  Please make use of the resources at <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/">http://www.w3schools.com</a> (or any site you like) for reference information as necessary.  You must write your page "by hand", meaning that you are not allowed to use an HTML editor or application which writes HTML for you.</li><br><br>

	<li>Create a file named FirstLast.html (where "First" is replaced with your first name and "Last" with your last name).  Create a title for your page (using the "title" tag) and a main heading (using the "h1" tag) with the text "First Last's page" (again substituting your name), and set the background color to something other than white (but which still allows you to read the text).</li><br><br>
	
	<li>Add an image of yourself.  Also add a sentence or two describing the page and a link to another web page (somewhere on the WWW, not included in this assignment).  Your link must be designed so that when clicked on, it opens the page in a new window (or tab).  [Hint: Look at the "target" attribute for links.]</li><br><br>

	<li>Add the necessary JavaScript so that when someone clicks on the image, it changes to a different image.  (This will mean that you need to include both images with your submission.)  Each time it is clicked, it should alternate between the images.</li><br><br>
	
	<li>Add the sentence: "Please push this to see more information about me.", where the word "this" is the text on a button (which is in the middle of the sentence).  Implement the necessary JavaScript code so that when the button is clicked, a paragraph appears which gives some background information about you (where you were born or whatever).  Each time the button is clicked it should toggle the display of that paragraph (causing it to be visible after the first click, hidden after the second, visible after the third, etc.).  Further, the line with the button in it should change to the following when the text is <b>visible</b>:  "Please push this to hide more information about me."  The words "see" and "hide" should alternate as the button is clicked.</li><br><br>
	
	<li>Add the sentence:  "Please push this to see my list of courses.", where the word "this" is once again on a button.  Implement the necessary JavaScript so that pushing that button toggles the visibility of an HTML <b>table</b> (i.e. using the "table" tag) which displays your courses.  There should be one column for the course names and one for the dates and times.  In exactly the same way as the first button works, this button should cause the table to alternate visibility and the words "see" and "hide" to alternate in the sentence containing the button.</li><br><br>

	<li>Here is the rubrick the grader will use, so make sure your page meets each of these requirements:
		<ol>
			<li>(5 points) Does the HTML file have the correct name?</li>
			<li>(5 points) Does the page have the correct title?</li>
			<li>(5 points) Does the page have the correct heading?</li>
			<li>(5 points) Is the background color set to something other than white?</li>
			<li>(5 points) Are there a few sentences about the page which include a link to an external page?</li>
			<li>(5 points) Does clicking on the link cause it to open in a new browser window or tab?</li>
			<li>(10 points) Does the page correctly load an image of the student?</li>
			<li>(20 points) Does repeated clicking on the image cause it to correctly alternate between two images?</li>
			<li>(20 points) Is there a button which can be clicked to toggle the appearance of a paragraph of text about the student?  Does the text in the sentence with the button correctly alternate?</li>
			<li>(20 points) Is there a button which can be clicked to toggle the appearance of a table containing the student's class schedule?  Does the text in the sentence with the button correctly alternate?</li>
		</ol>
		</li><br><br>

	<li>Submit a zip file in the usual manner. The zip file should contain your HTML file and image files.  Test your zip file before you submit it by extracting into a separate folder and then opening your web page from that new folder. Ensure that it works as expected, especially finding all images as necessary.</li><br><br>
</ol>
