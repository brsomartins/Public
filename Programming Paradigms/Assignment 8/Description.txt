You must implement six JavaScript functions in assignment8.js (which is provided with the assignment).  Details about each function are included within that file.  The file assignment8.html is provided as an example of how the grader will use your submitted assignment8.js for testing (assignment8.html will load assignment8.js).  The grader will change the test cases from those provided in assignment8.html.  You must submit exactly one file, assignment8.js and it should not be in a compressed file.  For grading:  A submission which loads correctly without throwing exceptions will be worth 10 points.  An additional 15 points will be awarded for each correctly working function.  For each function which works incorrectly (i.e. gives a wrong answer to a test case) but does not throw an exception when executed from the grader's assignment8.html you will receive 7 points.
